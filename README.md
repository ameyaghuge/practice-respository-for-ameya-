# I want to create a program where i ask where the ventolin puffer is and it tells me that it is right next to me 

#we need an input first 
# then we need to define it 
# and then return it to the user as well 
where = input

def ventolin ():
    global where
    where = input("Is your ventonlin puffer here?")
    if where == "yes":
        print("Yes, it's right next to me.")
        print("CONGRATULATIONS! YOU FOUND IT AWESOME, p.s you should take it now the pollen count outside it horrilbe")
    else: where == "no"
    print( "look around you it should be inside the house somewhere.")
    print("don't worry you will find it :)")
    
 
ventolin()

#this is my first ever program i wrote by myself for practice I'm asthmatic so this is helpful for me, 
# anways it was good practice and it was fun :)
# till next time github :))
