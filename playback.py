#implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).

#So we need an input 
#We need an output
#We need to replace each output with ... to replace each space

#input here 
Speak = input("What is it you wish to speak?")
#here it should replace the spaces with ... 
#how do i replace each space with ...?
publish = Speak.replace(" ", "â€¦")

#output here
print(publish)
